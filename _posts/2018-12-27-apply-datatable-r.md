## Columns of lists

Well... Finally some placeholder to write my own Blog about data.table in R that i will continue adding as i learn. In general based on my studies and experiments, it's known that data manipulation with data.table is [faster][1] than python pandas. 

Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and tutored by Hank Quinlan, Thank You!! It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
